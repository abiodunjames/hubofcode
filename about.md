#### Who am I?

A software developer and an amateur lifter. I started my development career in 2013 as a software engineer. 
Fast forward to 2017; I led a team in a startup company to build robust learning management solutions.  In 2018, I relocated to Germany, where I now work as a backend developer.  In my free time, I write tutorials and help other developers grasp new technologies as fast as possible.

At my leisure time, I enjoy watching superhero movies and playing ping pong.
