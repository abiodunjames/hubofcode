Hi, I'm Samuel, a Backend Engineer who loves building applications that remarkably change people's lives. I have a long history of transforming unproductive teams into productive teams that deliver on time. Besides development role, I enjoy teaching and helping developers grasp new technology and concepts. You will find me writing about code on major developers' websites and on my personal [blog](https://hubofco.de).

My software development experience span various industries like FinTech, EduTech, and PropTech. I code in Python, PHP, JavaScript and of course provision resources with Terraform. I run primarily on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and sometimes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

At the moment, I work at [Architrave GMBH](https://www.architrave.de/) where we use machine learning to bring order to chaotic jumble of documents in real estate.

Other Skills: MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker, PyTorch, MachineLearning, ComputerVision
