#### Who am I?

A software developer and an amateur lifter. I started my development career in 2013 as a software engineer.  I must tell you that nothing is as cool as knowing your work impacts lives.  This has been my motivation to date.

Fast forward to 2017; I led a team in a startup company to build robust learning management solutions.

Talk of remote working or committing to production while in your pajamas? Damn! I love it!   I have worked remotely as a contractor for a company in the US.  It was an excellent experience! 

In 2018, I relocated to Germany, where I now work as a backend developer.  In my free time, I write tutorials and help other developers grasp new technologies as fast as possible.


Enough of all these craps! Doesn't he do anything for fun?

Yes, I do. In my leisure time, I enjoy watching superhero movies and playing ping pong.
