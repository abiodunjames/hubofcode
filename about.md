Hi, 
I'm [Samuel James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abiodunjames/). I love writing code and helping developers grasp new concepts. I have been working professionally in the tech industry since 2013. I’ve held multiple software engineering positions from a software engineer position to a team lead position at startups.

I write a lot about code and technology in general. You’ll find my posts on major developers community platforms and blog pages of tech companies like [Stackify](https://stackify.com/aws-lambda-with-node-js-a-complete-getting-started-guide/), [Scalyr](https://www.scalyr.com), [Blue Medora](https://bluemedora.com/), [Testim](http://testim.io/), etc.

My software development experience spans various industries like FinTech, EduTech, and PropTech. At the moment, I work at [Architrave GMBH](https://www.architrave.de/) where we use machine learning to bring order to chaotic jumble of documents in real estate.
