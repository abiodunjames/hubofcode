Iâ€™m Samuel Abiodun James, I started programming at year two (2010) while studying industrial chemistry at the [University](https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/), I could not wait for graduation to dump Industrial Chemistry for this newly found passion.

Years later, I have learnt (still learning) how to be a better programmer, build complex web applications and architect AWS cloud infrastructure for optimum availability.

At my free time, I write tutorials here or on [medium](https://medium.com/@samuelabiodun/).
