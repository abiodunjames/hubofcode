A few days ago, I came across a link to a [post](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-teach-yourself-to-read-an-entire-book-in-a-single-day-485e35e28126) by [Thomas Oppong](https://medium.com/@alltopstartups) where he exposes techniques he employs to read an entire book in a single day. I jumped at it like a hungry lion to uncover secrets that will make me read more and maximize my time.

Reading can never be overemphasized. There are few ways to become good developers and one is to read books. We get a deep understanding of  development by reading and learning from people ahead of us.

January has always been a month of new resolutions for some people including me. I actually did make a lot of promises and one of them is to study like crazy and work out like hell till gym instructors chase me out of the gym to rest :).

Unfortunately, gym instructors haven’t chased me out yet and I have not gotten to read up to the capacity I wanted but I do have some books that added values to my life in January and would love to share them with you.

It’s most likely you have read some of them but if you have not, you should definitely read them. They are worth it.

[**Lumen Programming Guide- Writing PHP Microservices, Rest and Web Service APIs -Paul Redmond**](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484221860)

This book explains everything you need to know from setting up your development environment to creating rich APIs with Lumen Framework. If you want to write testable APIs with lumen: this is book for you.

[**PHP 7 Programming CookBook -Doug Bierer.**](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/php-7-programming-cookbook)

I’ve been interested in scalability for some time now and this was one of the books I enjoyed reading. It uncovers PHP 7 performance features, exposes ways to build scalable websites, shed light on developing middleware, design patterns and web security. He delves into advanced algorithm in PHP, best practices, and patterns. If you have not read this book, I encourage you to do so.

[**Developing Microservices with Node.Js – David Gonzalez**](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/developing-microservices-nodejs)

If you have ever wanted to write microservices in Node.Js David Gonzalez got your back on this. He uncovers everything you need to know to build your first microservice in Node.Js using Seneca.

[NodeJs for PHP Developers – Daniel Howard](https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-PHP-Developers-Porting/dp/1449333605)  
 This book is particularly good for PHP developers who want to learn or convert a PHP project to Node.Js. It takes you through all the steps to get started on building Node.Js application based on your existing knowledge of PHP

[Scaling PHP Apps – Steve Corona  
](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-PHP-Applications-Stephen-Corona-ebook/dp/B00BHN3SVW)  
 Of all the books I read in January, hats off to Steve Corona on this. He narrates his experience with scaling TwitPic and covers everything from DNS, MySQL to Nginx. The book is good for every PHP developer and most especially if you work with a startup company. Personally, this is one of the books I will continue to consult as  need arises.
