My team won the united nation Hackathon that took place in 9 regions of the world in 2017.

We had spent two nights working on an integrated transport system that gives commuters real-time information on bus routes, stops and fares via a mobile application, this we tagged “smart transit”.

The prototypes we pitched included a mobile and a web application integrated with Twilio API to enable users without a smartphone to interact  with the service using USSD code on non-smartphones.

A big thank you to my awesome team members for the hard work.
