Last week, I published an [article](https://codeburst.io/keeping-your-code-clean-d30bcffd1a10) that shows few ways you can keep your code clean on [Code burst](https://codeburst.io). The article was shared multiple times on various social media. If you have not seen it yet,[ read it here](https://codeburst.io/keeping-your-code-clean-d30bcffd1a10).

Every developer can recognize good and well-crafted code but not every developer writes clean code. Clean code is an art that must be learned and mastered.

In view of this, I created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/abiodunjames/Awesome-Clean-Code-Resources) that collates links to various resources (posts, books, videos) on clean code to make your learning to code clean a breeze.

Learn, share and most importantly, contribute.
